Tutorial Process

----------------------------------------------------
1.Get the software repository from github and install the software
you must install the GitHub Command Line Tools first.
then enter the local path you want to store it and clone it.

command line example:
#cd /usr/local
#git clone https://github.com/ysycloud/paraGSEA.git

Then,you can install the software easilly.

command line example:
#cd paraGSEA
#make all
#make install

If you want to clean the Intermediate files When you finished the work above,
you can use this command:
#make clean

At this time, you have finished all works before you can use the software.

----------------------------------------------------
2.Pretreatment
The original input data come from LINCS, which is evolved from the Connectivity Map project. 
The data is stored in the HDF5 file format with a gctx suffix. In order to use and analysis 
the data, we must use 1ktools, which is an OpenSource project published in github, to parse 
it and extract the information we care about.

Setting the MATLAB path:
Enter the "pathtool" command, click "Add with Subfolders...", and select the directory ParaGSEA/matlab_for_parse.

using by command line:
After you set the MATLAB path, you should enter "matlab" in shell to start matlab environment.
Then, you can set the input and output file path in runPreGSEA.m and enter "runPreGSEA" to parse the data.

3.GSEA by C Tools
There are several C Tools are implemented in our work. 
At the same time, we provided good interfaces to call these tools.

(1)Quick Search

--->Function:
	Implemented original GSEA Approach with GeneSet and Profiles

--->Input:
	1목a parsed profiles's file from pretreatment stage.
	2목GeneSet No. from 1 to  profile number corresponding to the first input밃
		Manual input any times until enter "exit" .

--->Output:
	TopN GSEA indexs including ES목NES and P values

--->Interfaces:
	1목quick_search_serial밐

				-hostfile hostfile:  list the IP or Hostname of nodes

				2)input matrix should include the same identity of rows and columns, which means stage 2 is supposed to use same two file as its input
				3)the first three parameters(process_num,pernum,hostfile) should not be changed compare with stage 2, so that the program can find all the distributed ES_Matrix file in all nodes

				1)you'd better keep the formula correct : process_num = pernum * number of IP(Hostname) list in hostfile
				2)input matrix should include the same identity of rows and columns, which means stage 2 is supposed to use same two file as its input
				3)the first three parameters(process_num,pernum,hostfile) should not be changed compare with stage 2, so that the program can find all the distributed ES_Matrix file in all nodes
				4)this version may get better results, but in determining the initial clustering center needs more overhead.
