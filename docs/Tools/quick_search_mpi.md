# quick_search_mpi #

This tool implemented original GSEA approach with GeneSet and Profiles
which will complete parallel GSEA in a multiprocesses way by MPI and 
show the topN results.

There are several parameters should be setted in command line example.

| parameter name | Parameter function |
| -------------- | -------------------|
| -n process_num | Total number of processes |
| -ppn pernum |the number of processes in each node |
| -hostfile hostfile | list the IP or Hostname of nodes |
| -i --input | a parsed profiles's ranked sequence number file from pretreatment stage |
| -n --topn | define the first and last N GSEA records ordered by ES |
| -s --sample | a text file include sample sequence numbers which are extracted from pretreatment stage |
| -r --reference | a directory include some reference data files we generate from pretreatment stage |

A sample `Shell script` file is given below that makes use of `quick_search_mpi`.

```shell
mpirun -n 2 -ppn 2 -hostfile example/hostfile quick_search_mpi -i data/data_for_test.txt -n 5 -s data/data_for_test_cidnum.txt -r data/Reference
```

the example hostfile just has one record as below:
```shell
localhost
```

However, there is a thing we must notice:
you'd better keep the formula `process_num = pernum * number of IP(Hostname) list in hostfile` 
correct.

It may will produce the following output:
```shell
Profile Set is Loading...!
profilenum:272	 genelen:978
Memory check......
Available Memory:      522318932 KB
Needed Memory:      1045 KB
loading IO and prework time by MPI: 0.0244 s
which way do you want to input the GeneSet( 0 -> standard input , others -> file input ):
```

if Available Memory is less than Needed Memory, It will produce the following output:
```shell
available memory is not enough!!! Please use more nodes!!!
```
and finish the program.

If Available Memory is enough, you can choose which way do you want to input the GeneSet. 
Choosing 0, then you must input a gene set directly. 

For example:
```shell
input the GeneSet until 'exit'( a string of each Gene Symbol split by space ):
CCNH HMGA2 IGFBP3 RB1 PARP1 CDK6
```

Or choosing Others, you must input a file path where there is a gene set. 
Most of times, Second way may be more convenient.

For example:
```shell
input the path of file that has GeneSet until 'exit'(each line has a Gene Symbol/name):
data/GeneSet.txt
```

It will produce the following output:
```shell

Then you can input the GeneSet again to continue to complete GSEA approach,
or, you can input `exit` to stop this tool as below:
```shell
input the path of file that has GeneSet until 'exit'(each line has a Gene Symbol/name):
exit
```
